Programming language used: Java - openjdk-23

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2.1

Compilation instructions: When using this IDE, simply press the Run button, and the program will compile automatically without the need to use the terminal. To make it work, you need to add the file path in line 24 to input one of the datasets.

Usage instructions: The program has a menu that asks the user which of the 4 sorting functions they want to use. Once an option is selected, the program proceeds to ask whether to sort in ascending or descending order. The results are then displayed on the screen.
To select which file the program uses for sorting, the file name must be changed in line 24 of the program to the desired file. If you want to change the number of tasks the program reads, you must open the file and modify the first line where the number is listed, as this value is used to determine how many elements the program will read from the file.
